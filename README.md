arma 3 mod, for zeus enabled tfar jamming


The vision is create a way for Zeus to add jammers to their senarios and potentially in future allow player-carried or vehicle carried jammers that could work against remote-detonation and potentially against LAMBS AI. Potentially also add Electronic Support Measures for help fight against jamming. 

Vision might also be to add spectrum device for tracking points placed in zeus

MSP - Zeus be able to set objects as jammers, and players will get jammed the closer to center of radius they get.
